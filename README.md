# bookbot
BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

main.py - main executable, calls relevant functions from stats.py
stats.py - contains all functions that main uses
wordcount - counts the words in the book and prints the value
characters - counts how often each alphabetical character appears
sorted_characters - sorts the dictonary from characters
